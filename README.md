## Introduction

# 🕵️‍♂️ An Undercover Operation into the World of DSA

🎉 Welcome, welcome, welcome! 🎉 Pull up a chair, code cowboys 🤠 and bug busters 🐜, to the mesmerizing spectacle that is the world of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)! This here repository is the brainchild of a gang of nocturnal code enthusiasts who traded sunlight ☀️ for semicolons ; and we couldn't be more grateful (though, a little Vitamin D never hurt anyone, folks! 😄).

Behold the treasure chest 🏴‍☠️ of the coding realm (sorry, no, there are no pirate's booty or magic lamps here 🧞), brimming with data structures and algorithms, brewed to perfection in a cauldron of diverse programming languages 💻. Whether you're a greenhorn computer science student 🎓, a grizzled veteran software developer 👨‍💻, or someone who wandered in here thinking DSA was some hot new DJ 🎧, well, you're in for a wild ride 🎢!

Venture forth into the dense jungle 🌴 of data structures, packed with everything from the hardy perennials of arrays and linked lists to the towering redwoods of trees and graphs 🌲. Got a hankering for algorithms? Well, pull up a chair to our all-you-can-code buffet 🍽️, overflowing with sorting, searching, dynamic programming, and even some of those tantalizingly spicy 🌶️ greedy algorithms!

Now, holster your fears 😱, saddle up your curiosity 🕵️‍♂️, and dive headfirst into this symphony of syntax 🎶! And remember to pack your sense of humor 😂 - it's going to be a bumpy ride! Enjoy the thrill of the chase 🏁, and remember, the 'fun' in 'functions' is not just there for decoration 🖼️!

And remember, you're not just in any coding repository. This is a crime scene 🕵️‍♀️, where every line of code could be the vital clue that cracks the case wide open 🔍. From novice code sleuths to those with a badge in algorithmic mysteries, there's a fascinating investigation waiting for you. So adjust your detective cap, bring your magnifying glass, and prepare to decode the complexities of DSA 🔐. Welcome to the thrilling whodunit of code - where each line tells its own captivating tale 📖!


## Repository Content

This repository contains:

1. **Data Structures**: A collection of common and advanced data structures implemented in languages like Python _(Coming soon in Java, Typescript, Go)_ 🤭. Some examples include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, etc.

2. **Algorithms**: Various algorithms in categories such as sorting, searching, dynamic programming, greedy algorithms, etc.
